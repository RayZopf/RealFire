Project to add some improvements to Linden Home fireplace (Meadowbrooks open fire)
=====================================================================
Aims
----
trying to get a nicer fire, smoke, sound, animated logs

Todo
----
keeping it low prim (using particles, producing lag)  
maybe add some flexi-prims (more landimpact, less laggy)  
rework some internal functions like
 - size of fire
 - change of fire/sound
 - settings notecard and verbosity
