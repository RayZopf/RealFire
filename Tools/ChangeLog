	- fix vector.s, vector.qqq, vector.1, etc (0010)
	- when a warning or error has extra lines of information, they will only be shown once
	- exit status is the number of errors in the script (negative or >128 for program errors)
	- added options: -# (show error numbers), -A (check error assertions)
		these are for debugging/regression testing, but you can use them to ignore warning
		messages. use -# to get the error number, and then add a comment like $[E12345]
		on the line you want to ignore that error number on. note that when using -A,
		warnings are treated as errors.

		- rewritten as pure/reentrant parser/lexer
		- logging abstracted for later sorting support
		- track and propogate constant values
		- better location tracking
		- fixed list parsing
