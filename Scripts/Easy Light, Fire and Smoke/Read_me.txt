PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND SHORT INSTRUCTIONS FOR EASY LIGHT, FIRE AND SMOKE

Date: 05-10-2014
Version: 1.0.2

In the course of time, more and more features have been added to Lighting System and RealFire, making them a bit daunting for the novice user. This package uses a different approach. No user manuals, no notecards, no complicated setup. Just light, fire and smoke that works. All you have to do is drop the script in a prim, change some prim names and touch it.

FEATURES

- Light: simple white light. Intensity can be changed.
- Fire: simple particle fire with smoke and sound. Size can be changed, smoke and sound can be turned off.
- Smoke: simple medium grey smoke. Size and alpha can be changed.
- Multiple light, fire and smoke sources: just change the name of the prims you want to use.
- Easy integration with other scripting projects. Check out EasyControl for an example.

MODIFYING THE SCRIPTS: SAFE AND EASY

The scripts should satisfy most needs right out of the box, but if you still need more options, check out the "Constants" section. Some examples: default intensity (light), default size (fire), RGB color (light/fire).

TEXTURES FOR EASYFIRE

Several textures have been included as a replacement for the default particle texture. Each of them will give the fire a slightly different look.

How to change the fire texture: right-click on a texture in your inventory, choose "Copy Asset UUID" and paste it into the script. Look for "fireTexture" in the "Constants" section.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

- The script will warn you if a prim needs a name change, and what it should be.
- Besides these warnings, the scripts are completely silent.
- If EasyLight or EasySmoke are in a single prim, there is no need to change the name.
- EasyFire always needs at least two prims, one for fire and one for smoke.
- The fire comes with its own smoke. EasySmoke is meant to be used as a "smoke-only" feature.
- EasyControl is an example script. Please disable at least some of the buttons before using it in production.
