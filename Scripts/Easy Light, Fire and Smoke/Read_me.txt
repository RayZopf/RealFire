PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND SHORT INSTRUCTIONS FOR EASY LIGHT, FIRE AND SMOKE

Date: 12-04-2014
Version: 1.0

As time passed by, Lighting System and RealFire have become overzealous and overcomplicated, not to mention daunting for the novice user. Time to go back to basics. No user manuals, no notecards, no complicated setup. Just light, fire and smoke that works. Period. All you have to do is drop the script in a prim, change some prim names and touch it.

FEATURES

- Light: simple white light. Intensity can be changed.
- Fire: simple particle fire with smoke and sound. Size can be changed, smoke and sound can be turned off.
- Smoke: simple medium grey smoke. Size and alpha can be changed.
- Multiple light, fire and smoke sources: just change the name of the prims you want to use.
- Easy integration with other scripting projects. Check out EasyControl for an example.

MODIFYING THE SCRIPTS: SAFE AND EASY

The scripts should satisfy most needs right out of the box, but if you still need more options, check out the "Constants" section. Some examples: default intensity (light), default size (fire), RGB color (light/fire). It's as simple as editing a notecard.

FINAL NOTES

- The script will warn you if a prim needs a name change, and what it should be.
- Besides these warnings, the scripts are completely silent.
- If EasyLight or EasySmoke are in a single prim, there is no need to change the name.
- EasyFire always needs at least two prims, one for fire and one for smoke.
- The fire comes with its own smoke. EasySmoke is meant to be used as a "smoke-only" feature.
- EasyControl is an example script. Please disable at least some of the buttons before using it in production.
